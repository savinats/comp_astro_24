# Computational Astrophysics – Exoplanet Detection & Atmospheric Retrieval  
Final project for *Computational Astrophysics (Physics of Data, UNIPD)  
Authors: Savina Tsichli, Marco Foster — July 2025

## Overview
This repo contains the code and results for detecting exoplanets from light curves and performing atmospheric retrievals.

Tasks covered:
- **Transit detection** with Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN)
- **Synthetic transit generation** using **BATMAN**
- **Atmospheric retrievals** using **TauREx**
- Systems studied: **MASCARA-3Ab** (synthetic modeling) and **WASP-39b** (real JWST spectrum)
